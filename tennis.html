          Tennis is a sport where the players use a racket to hit a ball over a net and onto the opponent's side of the court.
          If the opponent is not able to return the ball validly, a point is awarded.
          There are eight basic shots the player can use to hit the ball, some of these are: the serve, forehand, backhand, and lob.
          The tennis court can be made of a variety of surfaces: grass, clay, concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic, and artificial turf.
